    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Broiled salmon is incredibly moist and tender and perfect for a weeknight meal. The cooking time will depend on the thickness of the salmon; I suggest checking for doneness after 10 minutes.

        I made this with no alterations. I did just place the wedge of lemon on the fish as I couldn't find any instructions about what to do with it. Served with fresh green beans on the side, and it made a nice supper. Thanks for the recipe.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons maple syrup, divided </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce (such as Bragg®)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) skin-on center-cut salmon fillets</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>2 slices fresh pineapple, halved</li>
        <li>2 wedges lemon </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine 2 tablespoons maple syrup, soy sauce, lemon juice, and ginger in a bowl. Place salmon into the marinade and turn to coat. Marinate for at least 15 minutes, but no longer than 30.</li>

        <li>For the glaze, mix remaining 2 tablespoons maple syrup and Cajun seasoning together in a bowl. Set aside until ready to use.</li>

        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler to low.</li>

        <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and lightly spray with cooking spray. Remove the salmon from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Place salmon, skin side-down, and pineapple, onto the sheet and brush with the glaze.</li>

        <li>Broil in the preheated oven until salmon easily flakes with a fork and reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (62 degrees C), 13 to 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
